<h3>Internet privacy settings <br> are important because the websites you visit are tracking your web presence</h3>
<br>

<p>
This may not seem like a big deal, but imagine it happening in your daily life. You walk around in a store and some man you dont know is watching you and recording everything about you. Your demographics, the route you take through the isles, what you pick up, how long you look at it before putting it back or into your basket. Would you let him do this? or would you tell security on his creepy ass? How is this not okay, but you dont have a problem with this happening online... double standards man.</p>
<br>

<p>
How do you think facebook has that advert for the hair product you were just looking at a few days ago? Theyre watching you man... like serious serious. You know there is a way to stop them dude.. like just go to your privacy settings and block their ass on like everything.

Theres other things you can do too. Like using secure browsing like <br>https instead of http.
